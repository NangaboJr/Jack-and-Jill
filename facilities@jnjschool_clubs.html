                <h4>GOLF </h4>
                <p>Golf is an individual sport played by hitting a ball with a club from a tee into a hole. A standard golf course consists of 18 holes, where each hole is labeled as Par 3, 4, 5, 
                rarely a Par 6. "Par" in golf stands for the regulated amount of strokes it takes to get the ball into the hole. The idea of the game is to get the ball in the hole the fewest amount 
                of strokes as possible. First and foremost, golf is good exercise. Not only do you spend a lot of time on your feet, but you also do a lot of walking. In fact, most courses will have you walking around 4 miles by the end, 
                so you'll certainly get in your daily step goals. And whereas there's nothing wrong with playing golf with a friend, another benefit of playing golf is that you can make new friends.

                <h4>SKATING </h4>
                <p>Skating (floor) is a workout sport played while wearing skating shoes or boots mainly on the floor or a smooth terrace. There are different types of skating including <b>Jam skating;</b> usually practised with song beats
                <b>Inline Skating;</b> this is the popular type of skating and <b> Artistic or Ice Skating; </b> this is practised on ice fields by normally artistic or artistes persons. At Jack and Jill School we practise the <b>Inline Speed Skating.</b>
                We have team leaders and coaches training learners during club time/hour on ways to and how to skate. Junior learners and beginners are always provided with a support coach or an expert student 
                to help them gain confidence before starting the training. Our students/ learners are provided with safety tools and attires before entering the training or the skating fields, this helps is preventing injuries that may rise from mishandling or lack 
                of concentration for beginners.

                <h4>CHESS</h4>
                <P>When playing chess, your brain is challenged to exercise logic, develop pattern recognition, make decisions both visually and analytically, 
                    and test your memory. Chess can be enjoyed by any age as a result, these brain exercises can be part of the health of your brain for your entire life!
                    Our school provide this activities in clubs: Chess Club. Students with low memory of remembrance are advised to practise this analytical game not for fun 
                    but rather for exercise pattern development and recognition and analysis, thereby sometimes improving the pupils cognitive skills.

                <h4>SWIMMING</h4>
                <P>Swimming is a great workout because you need to move your whole body against the resistance of the water. 
                    This activity keeps your heart rate up but takes some of the impact stress off your body it also builds endurance, muscle strength and cardiovascular fitness
                    amongst other healthy benefit. As part of the co - curricular activities in the school calendar, Jack and Jill School students take part in swimming competition 
                    within the county and with prospects to win almost every swimming competition seasons. This has been necessitated since with reference to the club of choice the 
                    children, pupils and students visit the swimming pools for both rehearsals or body exercises on Wednesday: Every other Week

                    <mark>A debate is a discussion on a particular matter in a public meeting or a legislative assembly where opposing arguments are put forward
                        and which usually ends with a vote.  
                    </mark> A motion on the other hand is a topic under dispute in a debate.
                    In a debate they are three essential components which Jack and Jill School - Kitale is always keen to highlight i.e :
                    Case Construction, Refutation, and Case Rebuilding.
                    We understand that a debate serves a valuable tool for open mindedness and ability to consider multiple perspectives/ and hones skills in public speaking

                <P>Our computer lab is made large enough to host two classes of 30 learners. Computer studies unlike other beyond curriculum activities is taught 
                    in class. With studying computer and management, learners encounter different termsinologies related with computer science. This forms a basis of what to 
                    understand for future computer experts and engineers. Passionate students go ahead and even learn complex coding rather than just simple coding and 
                    computer applications which they are taugh for basic and foundational knowledge building. Computer studying is relatively significance in this era.
