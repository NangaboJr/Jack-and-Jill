                        <h4>Our Philosophy </h4>
                        <p>
                            A child's experiences during the preschool years influence later development and outlook
                             toward learning. Jack and Jill School is committed to our goal of helping each child 
                             develop a positive self-image. We provide many opportunities for accomplishment, in
                              offering a variety of materials, a safe and appealing environment in which to work
                               and play, and encouragement for the child to proceed at his/her own pace. As the 
                               child gains confidence in his/her abilities, he/she will also better the social 
                            interactions with peers and the adults in his/her life. The staff is here to facilitate the childs'
                             success in developing creativity, building a healthy self-concept, and acquiring self-direction. 
                             We intend to promote a sense of wonder and curiosity, to fuel the childs' enthusiasm for learning about
                             his/her world. We offer the opportunity for individual activities and participation in small groups.
                              We suggest daily outdoor experiences to use large muscles and develop 
                            those skills, as well as to learn about and interact with the outdoor environment.<br>
