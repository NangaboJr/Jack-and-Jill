                <h4>CHESS</h4>
                <P>When playing chess, your brain is challenged to exercise logic, develop pattern recognition, make decisions both visually and analytically, 
                    and test your memory. Chess can be enjoyed by any age—as a result, these brain exercises can be part of the health of your brain for your entire life!
                    Our school provide this activities in clubs: Chess Club. Students with low memory of remembrance are advised to practise this analytical game not for fun 
                    but rather for exercise pattern development and recognition and analysis, thereby sometimes improving the pupils cognitive skills.

                <h4>GOLF </h4>
                <p>Golf is an individual sport played by hitting a ball with a club from a tee into a hole. A standard golf course consists of 18 holes, where each hole is labeled as Par 3, 4, 5, 
                rarely a Par 6. “Par” in golf stands for the regulated amount of strokes it takes to get the ball into the hole. The idea of the game is to get the ball in the hole the fewest amount 
                of strokes as possible. First and foremost, golf is good exercise. Not only do you spend a lot of time on your feet, but you also do a lot of walking. In fact, most courses will have you walking around 4 miles by the end, 
                so you'll certainly get in your daily step goals. And whereas there's nothing wrong with playing golf with a friend, another benefit of playing golf is that you can make new friends.

                <b>Inline Skating;</b> this is the popular type of skating and <b> Artistic or Ice Skating; </b> this is practised on ice fields by normally artistic or artistes persons. At Jack and Jill School we practise the <b>Inline Speed Skating.</b>
                We have team leaders and coaches training learners during club time/hour on ways to and how to skate. Junior learners and beginners are always provided with a support coach or an expert student 
                to help them gain confidence before starting the training. Our students/ learners are provided with safety tools and attires before entering the training or the skating fields, this helps is preventing injuries that may rise from mishandling or lack 
                of concentration for beginners.

                         <p> I am a business analyst and operator / manager in Trans Nzoia county. I have had many business deals and contracts whichh I was able to apply and won through 
                            stiff competition from Jack and Jill School - KITALE. I have experienced great business contracts that are profitable and at the same time best to both 
                            our parties. Jack and Jill teachers and administration and the subordinate staff are literary the best people you can work alongside; they are very responsible.

                         <p> Iam a proud alumnus of Jack and Jill School Kitale class of 2011. I must confess I was the top student in Trans -Nzoia County
                            scoring 424 marks and was admitted to St Joseph Boys School KITALE. Working smart as the Director would quote from my primary school times made me who I am
                            today: A Residence Surgeon ( after studying Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery from the University of Nairobi.) well all my success is accorded to my basic years at this great school.
